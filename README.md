VPR Data
====

All data used to create VPR News Applications will be published in this repository.

This data is free to use, repurpose, and republish. See the included LICENSE for the legalese.

##Naming Conventions

###Directories

Data will be organized by project and build. The VPR Apps URL convention is as follows: `http://www.vpr.net/apps/project-name/build-name`

To find data for a particular build, go to the project directory and then the build directory. Each build directory is home to a README file explaining the data for that particular build.

###Variables

Variables are named using the following considerations, in order of importance:

1. Descriptive
2. Succinct
3. Consistent across:
    1. Build
    2. Project
    3. Repository

This naming convention has been applied to all of the CSV column headers throughtout this repository. Variable names are often, though not always, self explanatory. For variables that break any established convention, or require an additional description, a README has been included in every build.

###Geospatial Data

###Mapping the Money
Contains CSV files of the data used in the [Mapping the Money](http://www.vpr.net/apps/mapping-the-money/fed) project.
